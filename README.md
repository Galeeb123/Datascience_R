## Projects

This repository contains various projects and examples of data analysis using R. Some of the projects include:

- <ui><b>Exploratory Data Analysis of eruption dataset</b></ui> 
  -  In the folder `linear_regression` a simple linear regression model has been created to predict the eruption time based on the waiting time to the next eruption
  
- <b>Data Analysis & Prediction on engine quality</b> 
  -  In the folder `linear_regression` a multiple linear regression model has been created to predict how does the quality of the engine depends on various     variables</li>
- <b>Text mining and analysis with R</b>
   -  performed text mining and analysis on the text corpus. A typical text analysis pipeline which involves: (i) importing data (e.g. reading in files from a directory); (ii) cleaning and pre-processing text (e.g. removingpunctuation, converting words to lowercase and separating text into words â€“ tokenisation);
(iii) representing, filtering and weighting terms (e.g. as a document-term matrix); and 
(iv)performing data analysis (e.g. clustering or classifying texts) has been performed. All the corresponding files are available in the folder `NLP`
  
- <b>Exploring time-series data</b>
  -  The tine series data has been explored by using different visualizations to understand the data. To do so, the flights dataset contains for all flights that departed New York City (NYC) in 2013 has been analyzed.
  -  In addition to that correlation matrix and heatmaps has been generated to understand the relations between the different variables of the data
